(We would allow users to manually create pins to create small notes to put on the map)
1) Create a website

Key for Google API: AIzaSyD3C-R7oog-Ni87FFRrE-BYQMaKhX9vLAE

Target:
+ Front-end: Fixing Bugs, Making Notes on Marker (Khoa + Jose).
+ Back-end: Try to make the back end works just the same with coordinates, Figure out how to save the message information from front end.
+ Both: Add more detailed comments

To-be-fixed Bugs:
+ Front-end: Show/Hide button bug when the API return "ZERO-RESULT" status (no connection between two points). 
+ Notes: I tried to set global variable (not working in JSX), tried to pass function and setState (not working because you cannot setState in render method)
